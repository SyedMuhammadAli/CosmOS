NOTE: This project was developed as a part of my Operating System course in 2012, and has not been maintained since. The main ideas in this project are taken from the Operating System Concepts book by Abraham Silberschatz, Greg Gagne, and Peter Baer Galvin. The underlying VM is based on the specifications which can be found in the project.

Version   : 1.0 (alpha)
IDE		: Eclipse Indigo
Language	: Java

Notes:
Please note that that project "will not work" if AWT and SWT libraries are not installed.
Make sure you click the green "StartupVM" button before you process any files.

Every function is either well documented, or its functionality can be easily comprehended using its identifierâ€™s name.
